# Java-LinkedListSort

A simple Java program that demonstrates sorting a LinkedList of integers in ascending and descending order.

## Description

This project contains a Java program that creates a LinkedList with integer values, prints it, then sorts it in ascending order using `Collections.sort()`, prints it again, sorts in descending order, and prints the list again. It also attempts to print the original list in reverse order using the `reversed()` method.

## How to run

1. Ensure Java JDK is installed (version 8 or above).
2. Compile the program:
3. Run the compiled program:

## Notes

- The program uses `Collections.sort()` for sorting.
- The `reversed()` method called on the LinkedList will cause a compilation error as LinkedList does not have a `reversed()` method. Consider using `Collections.reverse()` or iterating over the list in reverse if needed.
